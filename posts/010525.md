By figuring it out.

> - Figure it out to build a website, and you'll find out what web development experience is.
> - Build a simple stock market pricing bot, and you'll find out if you like machine learning. 
> - Build a simple Android application and you'll know whether you want to build apps for your whole life or not. 

Yes, it's a little bit controversial to say that. You cannot find your passion or your dream job in a week. But you can understand how the web development components work. 

And if you do this consistently, building consistently, I'll guarantee you'll discover your passion. By the way, you can also talk with chatgpt to learn more about yourself. Gpt can give a list of career paths that fit your personality and character. Then try to go through those holes! 

If you're building in public, like sharing this journey publicly on twitter or linkedin, that's 10 times better, 'cause some people will follow your journey and it'll help you later on to find a job.

>So; 
> - build consistently, 
> - build in public,
> - enjoy the journey
