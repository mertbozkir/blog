Magnum opus means the greatest achievement of somebody. 

In life, yes, we're doing a lot of shallow work. And we'll probably do these works in the future too. (It never ends)

But always remind yourself that you're after something big. You've a really important task. That's your magnum opus. 

You need to improve yourself, broaden your vision, and expand your network. All will serve your magnum opus later. You need to develop your unique POVs. 

> How?
> - read books
> - follow high-quality people in your field.
> - watch movies, especially IMDB> 8
> - explore the horizontal bar in the T (t-shaped career).
> - generalize early as much as you can! 
> - then specialize later as hard as you can

`+` People always says that you're the average of the 5 people you're hanging out with the most. So, hang out with legends! (At the end of the day, you gotta become a legend to hang out with them! :) )
