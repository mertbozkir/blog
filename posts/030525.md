1. You are both your greatest enemy and your closest friend.
2. When asking someone a question, first share your own thoughts—then ask what they think.
3. When making a decision, don’t just think about the choice—think about the consequences it brings.
4. Life is a ultramarathon not a 300-meter sprint, always think long-term.
5. No one can harm you more than you can.
6. You can meaningfully connect with at most 150 people—see [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)
7. Being alone doesn't mean being lonely—you’re with your best friend: yourself.
8. All people will go away — your family, your loved one, your current best friends. But you'll always have yourself by your side.
9. Life is a complex optimization problem. Everything is a trade-off.
10. If something makes you sad, behind it there's probably you.
