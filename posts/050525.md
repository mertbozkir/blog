I get you!

It's tough.

Remember, you're still at the beginning of the journey.

Prioritize your health above everything.

After three years, you're going to look back at this thought and laugh!

And nobody will remember those days — only you will. So, don't compare yourself to other people.

Focus on building, and work consistently hard.

The future is really crazy — become crazy to build the future with awesome people!

Take care...
