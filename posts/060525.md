UVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV!

> I really love this project setup, everything easier with this.

After creation of the directory, starts with `uv init . --package --python 3.11`

Then you gotta move the `__init__.py` file under the src folder.

And you will have this project directory, correctly initialized with uv!

Go to the pyproject.toml file

Change this line: 
```python
[project.scripts]
aether = "src:main" # it was project-name:main
```

+ Add this at the end.

```python
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src"]
```

And after all the development, you should just do `uv pip install -e .`

then you can run your project with `uv run project-name`

**I also really like adding ruff: `uv pip install ruff`**

to my precious friend! ❤️
