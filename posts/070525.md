I normally hate reading books. During all of high school, I read just a bunch of books.

Here are my favs from high school:
- How to win friends: Carnegie Mallen
- Alamut: Vladimir Bartol
- Improbable: Adam Fawer
- Robinson Crusoe: Daniel Defoe
- Shibumi: Trevanian

But somehow I ended up not liking reading books, and my relationship with them has had a lot of ups and downs!

It’s really hard to find a book that you can finish. You really need to enjoy it a lot to get through a 300-page book.

Later, at university—again, I wasn’t reading books until Corona times. We did a challenge with my friends Sema, Kübra, Selim, and Didem (who had been consistently beating me in previous months!).

After coronavirus, I again stopped reading. It wasn’t ups and downs this time, just downs :/


Building a habit both that needs your focus and boring is like really hard...

But this time I’ve got a feeling that it’s gonna last really, really long—maybe even forever (exaggerating).

Here are my university fav books;
- Outliers: Malcolm Gladwell
- Origins: Dan Brown
- 1984: George Orwell
- No More Mr. Nice Guy: Robert Glover
- Deep Work: Cal Newport
- So Good They Can't Ignore You: Cal Newport
- The Game: Neil Strauss
- The Little Prince: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
